# Breaking down multiple `require` statements instead of using `&&`

## Details
Require statements including conditions with the && operator can be broken down in multiple require statements to save gas.
See reference: [G-09] of https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-04-backd/

## Mitigation
I suggest breaking down six conditions into six `require` statement instead of using `&&`. Example:
Changing from:
```
require(_startTimestamps.length == length &&
        _endTimestamps.length == length &&
        _cliffReleaseTimestamps.length == length &&
        _releaseIntervalsSecs.length == length &&
        _linearVestAmounts.length == length &&
        _cliffAmounts.length == length, 
        "ARRAY_LENGTH_MISMATCH"
        );
```
to:
```
require(_startTimestamps.length == length,"ARRAY_LENGTH_MISMATCH");
require(_endTimestamps.length == length,"ARRAY_LENGTH_MISMATCH");
require(_cliffReleaseTimestamps.length == length,"ARRAY_LENGTH_MISMATCH");
require(_releaseIntervalsSecs.length == length,"ARRAY_LENGTH_MISMATCH");
require(_linearVestAmounts.length == length,"ARRAY_LENGTH_MISMATCH");
require(_cliffAmounts.length == length,"ARRAY_LENGTH_MISMATCH");

```

# Pre-increment cost less gas than post-increment

## Details
`i++` costs more gas than `++i` , for uint pre-decrement is cheaper than post-decrement
see reference: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx-findings/issues/195

## Mitigation
change `i++` to `++i`

# Functions that are not called within the contract must set its visibility to `external` instead of `public`

## Details
Setting function's visibility to external when it is only called externally can save gas because external functionâ€™s parameters are not copied into memory and are instead read from calldata directly.
see reference: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro-findings/issues/37

## Mitigation
Set function visibility to `external`
